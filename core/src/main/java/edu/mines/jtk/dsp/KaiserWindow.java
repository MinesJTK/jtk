/**
 * The Kaiser window is often used in FIR filter design. It is easy to 
 * use and exhibits near-optimal properties for many filter design 
 * problems. The window is defined by any two of three parameters: 
 * window length, transition width, and maximum absolute error.
 * <p> 
 * For definiteness, assume that the Kaiser window is a function w(x) 
 * of argument x. Then, the window length is that range of x, centered 
 * about x = 0, for which the Kaiser window is non-zero. In other words, 
 * w(x) = 0 for |x| &gt; length/2. When windowing functions of time, both 
 * the window length and the argument x of w(x) have dimensions of time. 
 * <p>
 * The transition width is the width of the central lobe in the Fourier 
 * transform of the window. For band-pass filters, this is the width of 
 * the transition between pass and stop bands. When windowing functions 
 * of time, the dimensions of transition width are cycles per unit time
 * (frequency). In any case, the product of window length and transition 
 * width is dimensionless.
 * <p>
 * The maximum absolute error corresponds to the magnitude of ripples in 
 * the passbands and stopbands of windowed filters. For an ideal band-pass 
 * filter that has magnitude one in the pass band, the maximum (or minimum) 
 * amplitude in the passband of a windowed filter is one plus (or minus) 
 * the maximum amplitude error. Likewise, the maximum amplitude in the 
 * stopband of such a windowed filter equals the maximum amplitude error.
 * <p>
 * Kaiser windows are based on approximate relationships among the three
 * design parameters. These approximations break down for passbands and
 * stopbands that are narrow relative to the transition width. In such
 * cases, the actual maximum error may exceed a specified maximum error 
 * for which a Kaiser window is designed by up to a factor of two.
 * <p>
 * When constructing a Kaiser window for a specified window length and 
 * transition width, the product of these two parameters cannot be less
 * than one. When length*width is less than one, a useful upper bound for 
 * the maximum absolute error cannot be obtained from the Kaiser window 
 * design equations. However, in this case, the lower bound for maximum 
 * absolute error is nearly 10%, which is too large for most applications
 * anyway. Therefore, in practice, this restriction seldom matters.
