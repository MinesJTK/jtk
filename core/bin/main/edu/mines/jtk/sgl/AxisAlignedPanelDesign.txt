Dave Hale's notes for design of 
AxisAlignedFrame
AxisAlignedPanel 
AxisAlignedQuad
AxisAlignedBox
ImagePanel

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

public enum Axis
  X,Y,Z

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

public class AxisAlignedBox extends Group implements Selectable, Dragable
  constructs six frame children
    can get frame for any of six faces of box
  moving and resizing with mouse
    constructs and manages handles
    implements selection and dragging
  when corners set explicitly
    sets corners of frames

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

public class AxisAlignedQuad extends Group implements Selectable, Dragable
  constructs one frame child
    can get frame
  moving and resizing with mouse
    constructs and manages handles
    implements selection and dragging
  when corners set explicitly
    sets corners of frame

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

scenario
  user drags quad
  quad sets frame corners
  frame constrains corners

scenario
  panel added to frame (dirty bsphere and draw)
  panel sets box constraint of frame
  frame constrains corners (dirty bsphere and draw)

scenario
  panel changes its sampling (dirty bsphere and draw)
  panel sets box constraint of frame
  frame constrains corners (dirty bsphere and draw)

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

public class AxisAlignedFrame extends Group
  typically constructed by parent quad or box
  has axis
    initialized when frame constructed
    accessible and immutable
  has corners
    initialized when frame constructed
    accessible and mutable (dirty bsphere and draw)
  when a child panel is added
    ensures panel's frame is currently null
    sets panel's frame to this
  when a child panel is removed
    ensures panel's frame is this frame
    sets panel's frame to null
  has a box constraint (null if none)
    typically set by panels
      last constraint set rules

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

public class AxisAlignedPanel extends Node
  may be constructed with a frame or not
  when non-null frame is set (when child panel is added to frame)
    gets its box constraint (default is null; may be overridden)
      if not null, sets box constraint of frame
  if parent is a frame
    implements pick and computeBoundingSphere 
      using frame axis and corners
  else
    does not implement pick or computeBoundingSphere

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

public class ImagePanel extends AxisAlignedPanel
  constructed with samplings and floats
  knows what box constraint
  when sampling changes
    sets box constraint of frame
  has a cache of textures
  implements draw
    if necessary, updates texture cache
    draws textures
